Fast Start starts newly created characters with some gifts! You will be granted better than copper tools, weapons, gear and more!
Items given are randomly selected.

It's programmed as follows: 
If you receive a platinum pickaxe, you can no longer get a platinum tier axe and hammer. 
If you then get the next highest tier axe, which is gold, you can no longer get platinum and gold tier hammer! 
This works the same for any other items so get, with some exceptions. 
If you're lucky, you'll get both life AND mana crystals!

Can also grant things such as: slime staff, money trough, grappling hook and more!

Changelog for v0.5:
- You can no longer get Crystal Vile Shard as this is a hardmode item.
- Added Vilethorn as a replacement for Crystal Vile Shard.
- You can no longer get Diamond Ring as this item is worth a lot of money.
- You can now get Balloon Animal or Bundled Party Balloons as your vanity gifts.
- You will now get between 20 and 55 wood, stone blocks and torches.
- The amount of wooden arrows you can get is reduced by 100.
- The amount of throwing daggers and shurikens you can get is reduced by 10.
- If you are lucky, you can now also get a Wand of Sparking. That thing is dang hard to find sometimes.
